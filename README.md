assumptions + notes

* the mutations createFruitForFruitStorage() and storeFruitToFruitStorage() have the arguments 'limit' and 'amount' in them respectively. therefor i'm assuming that each "Fruit" has a maximum limit that can be stored and that the mutation storeFruitToFruitStorage additively increments the count by the value in the argument 'amount'.
* the fact that nexus requires --transpile-only to remove type checking is not a good approach. ide type safety is not sufficient. compiled even with type errors present. most of the time you only notice once that particular file is opened. too easy to miss. have to remove --transpile-only and run ocassionally to ensure no type errors
